Qt C++ client created by Integrated Computer Solutions, Inc. (ICS) that uses the Google Places API. The Google Places API is a service that returns information about Places -- defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest -- using HTTP requests. Place requests specify locations as latitude/longitude coordinates. Once you register your application in the Google API Console, you can use this API as part of your Google account.
